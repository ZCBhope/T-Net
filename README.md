# Implementation for T-Net
Here is our core model code, including the T-Net architecture, PCSE Block, weighted_8points, and residual computation. (We will upload all code after accepted)

I am sorry that one transverse line missing in Figure 1, due to trying hard to reduce blank space. We are sorry. Here we show the complete Figure 1.

We evaluate the performance of T-Net and compare it with recent state-of-the-art methods on outdoor **YFCC100M** and indoor **SUN3D**. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Performance comparison for camera pose estimation on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets. Results **with**/**without** RANSAC post-processing are reported.
