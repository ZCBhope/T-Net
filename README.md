# Implementation for T-Net
Here is our core model code, including the T-Net architecture, PCSE Block, weighted_8points, and residual computation. (We will upload all code after accepted)

I am sorry that one transverse line missing in Figure 1, due to trying hard to reduce blank space. We are sorry. Here we show the complete Figure 1.

We evaluate the performance of T-Net and compare it with recent state-of-the-art methods on outdoor YFCC100M and indoor SUN3D. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance.
